              Our small group wanted to ensure that skills and expertise arenâ€™t
              wasted when Ukrainian families are building new homes, whether
              temporary or for the future.
            </p>
            <p>
              We want to match the needs of European employers with the
              qualifications of the highly educated Ukrainian people.
            </p>
            <p>
              We also want to simplify research and job-hunting for people who
              are on the move, most of them mothers who have responsibility for
              children.
            </p>

              Europratsy CIC was founded in the UK as a not-for-profit
              organisation to fund the web-hosting and to employ the Ukrainian
              employees who deliver the translation services. Volunteers across
              Europe research and post updates on employment law and visas.

  We invite Ukrainians to Europe
</h1>

Nobody likes leaving their home, let alone being forced out of it.

The goal of this project is to help Ukrainians citizens:
1. Get their CV's translated;
2. Find job opportunities in EU (in English, and Ukrainian);
3. Find fair employers that won't take advantage of their situation;

Project is going to be open sourced, written in Gatsby so if you wish to contribute, reach out via contact form on the website, or open issue on Github.

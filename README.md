<h1 align="center">
  We invite Ukrainians to Europe
</h1>

Since the beginning of war in Ukraine, more than one million people left the country. It is estimated that 5.000.000 Ukrainians will leave their homes in 2022. It is pur mission to help them feel welcomed in the EU, and by future employers.

Nobody likes leaving their home, let alone being forced out of it.

The goal of this project is to help Ukrainians citizens:

1. Get their CV's translated;
2. Find job opportunities in EU (in English, and Ukrainian);
3. Find fair (vetted) employers that won't take advantage of their situation;

Project is open source, written in Gatsby+Sanity.io, so if you wish to contribute, reach out via contact form on the website, or open issue on Github.
